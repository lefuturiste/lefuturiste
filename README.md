# Hi, I'm lefuturiste ðŸ‘‹

I'm a developer who like to build website and robots.

I use plenty and various technologies but I code mainly in Vue.js, Node.js, Python and PHP.

Right now I'm working on a robot for the [French robotic cup](https://www.coupederobotique.fr/) with my team [We Robot](https://github.com/werobot-france).

My other mains projects are [RetroBox, the open source console](https://retrobox.tech) also [on github](https://github.com/retrobox) and [Statuer](https://github.com/statuer).

I like to spend some of my time on open source projects like [Jobatator](https://github.com/jobatator/jobatator) a project in Go or [Vue-Apitator](https://github.com/lefuturiste/vue-apitator) a plugin for Vue.js.
